                <p class="main__description">
                    One of the most notorious activities of the KKK is its use of violence and intimidation tactics against minority groups, including African Americans, Jews, and immigrants. Lynchings, cross burnings, and other acts of terror were employed to instill fear and maintain white supremacy.

                <p class="main__description">
                    The KKK actively promoted racial segregation by advocating for laws and policies that enforced the separation of white and non-white communities. This included supporting Jim Crow laws and opposing efforts towards desegregation in schools and public facilities.

                <p class="main__description">
                    At the core of its activities, the KKK propagated a supremacist ideology that promoted the belief in the superiority of the white race. This ideology fueled hate and discrimination against people of color, immigrants, and religious minorities.
