                <p class="main__description">
                    The KKK's influence on American politics has been significant throughout history. In the early 20th century, KKK members held positions in local, state, and even federal government offices, influencing legislation that promoted segregation and disenfranchised minority communities.

                <p class="main__description">
                    The KKK actively engaged in voter suppression tactics, particularly targeting African American voters. This included intimidation, violence, and literacy tests designed to prevent minorities from exercising their right to vote, effectively suppressing their political voice.

                <h2 class="main__section-title">Modern-Day Extremism</h2>
                <p class="main__description">
                    While the formal influence of the KKK in politics has waned over time, its legacy continues to shape extremist ideologies and influence certain political movements. White supremacist groups and individuals still espouse KKK-like rhetoric, perpetuating hate and division in society.
